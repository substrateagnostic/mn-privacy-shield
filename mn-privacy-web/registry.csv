We help our clients identify people who might be interested in their marketing offers. Sometimes our research is intended to help our clients find new donors or customers, others to find new ways to serve or connect with existing donors or customers. But whether they are our clients, the American consumer, or others, we care about people, and provide consumers with privacy choices. We have provided a form and a toll free number on our website at www.Wiland.com/privacy-choices for consumers to submit requests under the CCPA.  We believe in honoring consumers' privacy choices, as described above. We do not currently make consumer information publicly available via a website or other online service, nor do we currently host public websites where other consumers could post this information.   Please see www.Wiland.com/Privacy-Choices for more information about our products and services, how we use and protect consumer personal information and how consumers can exercise their privacy choices.  We use consumer data for the purpose of creating products and services intended to help consumers receive relevant marketing offers and to reduce marketing waste and unwanted advertising. We require our clients to use our products only for marketing related activities, and not for sensitive decisions like credit, employment or housing. In addition, we limit the type of data we receive and the type of data we share in the interest of consumer privacy. We don't possess or utilize sensitive data like credit card or bank account numbers, Social Security Numbers or other government-issued identifiers. We do not accept or generate information specifying individuals' health conditions (such as protected health information, aka ""HIPAA data""). We don't release information to third parties concerning specific items that a consumer has purchased, what magazines they read, or what charities they support unless requested by the organization with whom the consumer has a relationship.  Our marketing products and services are designed only for use in marketing to United States consumers above the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect information about consumers residing in other locations (such as Europe) or about children.  We seek to work only with reputable organizations.  After all, we are consumers too, and care deeply how consumer data is used.  We have a documented client approval process that is reviewed and updated periodically. We don’t work with clients whose product or service we believe to be illegal, fraudulent, pornographic or harmful to families.  Executive officer approval is required for accepting an engagement with a new client.  We belong to several industry groups such as the Data and Marketing Association division of the ANA and the Digital Advertising Alliance. One reason these self-regulatory groups exist is to ensure that companies commit to honoring consumer choice. In addition to the privacy choices we offer consumers directly, we encourage consumers to utilize industry solutions, such as the DMA mail and email preference services and the DAA Ad Choices service to cast a broader net for their advertising choices.  The DMA consumer choice website is: https://dmachoice.org/.  The DAA consumer choice website is: http://youradchoices.com."

The reported metrics associated with consumers' requests to opt out of the sale of ""publicly available information"" from its public websites in 2023 aggregates the number of requests received through the Thatsthem.com website and through the Spokeo website.  

Spokeo aggregates the number of requests complied with in whole or in part.

All requests submitted in accordance with the instructions provided in the privacy policies posted on the Spokeo and Thatsthem.com websites are processed in real time following completion of the request submittal.

Spokeo does not use or disclose sensitive personal information.","The information sold by Spokeo consists of ""publicly available information"" as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which is excluded from the definition of ""personal information"" and subject to First Amendment protections for free speech, and information subject to the GLBA to which the CCPA does not apply.  

Nevertheless, Spokeo elects to be included in this registry to inform CA residents about the nature of the publicly available information that Spokeo provides on its public websites and how to opt-out.

The categories of publicly available information that are available on Spokeo’s websites are described in Spokeo's Privacy Policy located at https://www.spokeo.com/privacy-policy and in the ""Where does Spokeo's profile data come from?"" section on this webpage: https://www.spokeo.com/privacy/control/all-categories.

Spokeo enables all consumers, including CA residents, to opt out from having their publicly available information available on Spokeo's public websites. Consumers may complete their opt out request online by using our self-help tool located at https://www.spokeo.com/optout.  As of the writing of this registration, an opt out completed from this page will opt a consumer out from all public Spokeo websites except Thatsthem.com.  To opt out from having their publicly available information available on Thatsthem.com, consumers may submit their opt out request at https://www.thatsthem.com/optout.

Consumers may also submit their opt-out request by contacting Spokeo Customer Care via any of the contact methods listed at https://www.spokeo.com/contact (which includes a nationwide toll free number).

We are a publishing and media company.  We had total revenue of $14.1 million dollars in 2024.  Of that, we generated a total of $564,200 from payments made to us by third party advertisers to access our data as we approved.  That amounts to 4% of our revenue.  For whatever it’s worth, in 2023 we received 0 consumer requests regarding data.  In 2024 we received 77 consumer requests to exercise their CCPA rights.  While we added all 77 of those individuals to our global opt-out file so that they could not ever receive our messages going forward, not a single one of them even existed in our data prior to their request.  Not one. Since we send emails and texts to our customers (and never physical mail or the like), we lack information on the actual residency of our customers — unless they tell us that information in a CCPA rights request for instance.  Under all the regulations from the CPPA link below, I doubt very much that we should ever have registered as a CA Data Broker in the first place.  But in case we might have 100,000 CA residents in our data and not know it, I have decided to continue the registration."

The following requests do NOT form part of our reporting:
 1.  LoopMe provides Consumers the ability to opt out of any “sales” or “shares” of their personal data via a web cookie-based opt out tool and a Device ID opt out tool. When a Consumer uses these tools, LoopMe deletes the identifier that we otherwise use to engage in these practices. In line with our data minimization policies, we did not record how many people exercised this choice in the previous calendar year. In light of new legal requirements, LoopMe is now working to include this additional reporting. 
2. Incomplete Requests: We can only process requests where we have all of the required information. For example, we cannot action requests if only the name and/or email of an individual are provided because we do not process that data. In each such case, we responded to the requestor asking for further information required to process the request, and could only process such request where the required additional information was provided.

PureCars customers are auto dealerships that are regulated by the GLBA. For these customers, PureCars offers the following products and services: TruPayments, The AutoMiner, and PureIdentity. PureCars receives NPI from its dealership customers, including from leasing transactions. 

PureCars separates the AutoMiner and PureIdentity business lines’ technical environment from its TruPayments business line’s technical environment. 

For all of its business lines, dealerships have their own tenants that are logically separated. For its targeted advertising service, PureCars will combine a single dealership’s NPI with additional sources of personal information, such as from data brokers, which PureCars shares with third-party platforms, such as Google or Meta. PureCars does not share customer data with other customers.

To prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, each request required extensive manual verification, significantly increasing processing time.
